# 🗑️ Smart Dustbin Automation

An Arduino-powered smart dustbin designed for contactless waste disposal using ultrasonic sensors and a servo motor. This project promotes hygiene and automation in public and domestic environments.

## 🔧 Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- SG90 Servo Motor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- Power Supply

## 🚀 How It Works

The ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors the distance in front of the dustbin. When a person’s hand or object comes within a predefined range (e.g., <15 cm), the servo motor automatically opens the lid. After a short delay, the lid closes again, ensuring minimal contact and efficient operation.
