# Smart-Dustbin-Automation
An Arduino-powered smart dustbin using ultrasonic sensors and servo motor for contactless waste disposal.


# 🗑️ Smart Dustbin Automation

A contactless waste disposal system built using Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, and a servo motor. Designed to promote hygiene and automation in public and household environments.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🤖 Automatic lid opening based on proximity detection
- 📏 Real-time distance sensing using HC-SR04
- 🔄 Servo motor control for smooth lid operation
- 🧼 Promotes hygienic, touch-free waste disposal
- 🔌 Compact and low-power design

## 🧠 How It Works

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance in front of the dustbin. When an object (like a hand) comes within 15 cm, the servo motor rotates to open the lid. After a short delay, the lid closes automatically.
